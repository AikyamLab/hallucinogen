# HALLUCINOGEN: A Benchmark for Evaluating Object Hallucination in Large Visual-Language Models

## Introduction

### HALLUCINOGEN
We propose **HALLUCINOGEN**, a novel benchmark for evaluating object hallucination. Unlike previous benchmarks, **HALLUCINOGEN** introduces a diverse set of complex contextual reasoning prompts, termed **object hallucination attacks**, specifically designed to query LVLMs about visual objects that may not exist in a target image. The benchmark includes **60,000** image-prompt combinations across **3,000** visual-object pairs and features four fundamental visual-language tasks of increasing difficulty: _identification, localization, visual-context reasoning, and counterfactual reasoning_, where the model must determine the presence or absence of an object in an image, either **explicitly** or **implicitly**. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art LVLMs and demonstrate that most perform close to random guessing when challenged with our proposed **object hallucination attacks**.

### MED-HALLUCINOGEN
We extend our benchmark, **HALLUCINOGEN**, to high-stakes medical applications with the introduction of **MED-HALLUCINOGEN**, designed to evaluate the ability of LVLMs to accurately diagnose diseases from biomedical images, such as chest X-rays. MED-HALLUCINOGEN consists of **3,000** unique X-ray and disease pairs, each paired with ten hallucination attack promptsâ€”five for disease identification and five for localization.
